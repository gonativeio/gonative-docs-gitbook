# Android package name

Unlike the iOS Bundle Id, your app's Android Package Name is visible to users in your app's Google Play Store URL. It is not possible to change your app's Package Name once your app is published.

Google recommends the Package Name follow reverse domain name service notation. For example, if your website is `example.com`, your Package Name might be `com.example.app`.

Note that dashes or spaces are not allowed. Also, it's not permitted to start any section of the package name with a number.
