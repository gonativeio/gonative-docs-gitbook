# iOS Bundle Id

The Bundle Id is never visible to end users. However, it is required to match the provisioning profiles and certificates you set up in your Apple developer account prior to publishing.

Apple recommends the Bundle Id follow reverse domain name service notation. For example, if your website is `example.com`, your Bundle Id might be `com.example.app`.
