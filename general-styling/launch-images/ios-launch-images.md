# iOS launch images

We use a "launch storyboard" for iOS to configure your app's launch images. This is to simplify launch image support across a wide range of device sizes and resolutions, and is also required by iOS to support the larger iPad devices at native resolutions.

When you configure your app via our website, you may auto-generate your launch storyboard from one of the other images you've already uploaded such as the app icon, or upload a new image that you'd like to use.

If you'd like to specify your own full-screen launch images for each device type, please see our knowledge base article at [https://support.gonative.io/help/how-to-specify-full-screen-launch-images-for-ios](https://support.gonative.io/help/how-to-specify-full-screen-launch-images-for-ios).
