# Force viewport width

### **Configuration**

This setting allows you to optionally force a page width for all URLs in your app. Before modifying this setting, we first suggest altering the viewport meta tag on your actual website.

If the scaling of your app looks too zoomed-out, or if you find yourself panning around the pages within your app, a custom viewport may help. Consider setting "Force Viewport Width" to a number like 600 to force scale things properly.
