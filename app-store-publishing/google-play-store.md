### **Submitting Your Build**

You may take the Android APK file generated by GoNative and available on your GoNative app's manage page, and upload it directly to Google as part of your app store submission. You may also download the complete Android source code and generate the APK yourself.

Similar to Apple, you will have to fill out an assortment of data regarding your app store listing, including app name, description, screenshots, several image assets, a content rating, and more.

Once submitted, your Android app should be live in Google Play app store within a few hours.
