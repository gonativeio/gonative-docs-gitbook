# Overview

Push Notifications are an incredibly powerful feature. When selected, we integrate OneSignal's Push SDK into your app to support the full range of what you might want to do with push notifications.

OneSignal offers a feature-rich, enterprise-class push notification service with a very good free tier offering. Learn more at [OneSignal.com](https://onesignal.com/).

* Send push notifications to individual devices, groups of devices, or all devices at once
* Send via the OneSignal.com dashboard, or programmatically through their API
* Optionally specify a targetUrl to open within your app when the notification is clicked
* Support for custom notification sounds, badging, collapsing notifications, and more

### Integrating other push notification SDKs

There are many other push notification providers available. If you would like us to integrate a different provider's SDK, or have specific requirements, please email us for a customized quote.
